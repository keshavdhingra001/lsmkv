# Checkpoint log

Single source of truth for "where are we". Update at the end of every session.

## Roadmap

### Tier 1: Baseline
- [x] **M0** Scaffold: crate layout, error type, Db glue, REPL, tests for M1/M2 *(Claude)*
- [x] **M1** Memtable: `put` / `delete` / `get` with tombstones *(Claude; 7/7 tests pass; owner review pending)*
- [x] **M2** WAL: `append` / `replay`, CRC32 per record, torn-tail handling *(Claude; 18/18 tests + manual kill -9 recovery check; owner review pending)*
- [x] **M3** SSTable writer + reader: data blocks, index block, footer *(Claude; 43/43 tests incl. corruption + randomized; owner review pending)*
- [ ] **M4** Flush memtable -> SSTable at size threshold; read path checks memtable then SSTables newest-first; manifest *(you)*
- [ ] **Gate:** Tier 1 done -> make the GitHub repo public

### Tier 2: Strong (target)
- [ ] **M5** Compaction (decide: leveled vs size-tiered), drop tombstones safely
- [ ] **M6** Bloom filters per SSTable + LRU block cache
- [ ] **M7** Durability modes: per-write fsync / group commit / periodic; measure each
- [ ] **M8** Concurrency: snapshot reads that never block the writer
- [ ] **M9** Range scans: merging iterator across memtable + levels
- [ ] **M10** Crash-injection harness (random kill -9, verify no acked write lost) + model-based fuzz test
- [ ] **M11** Benchmarks (ops/sec, p50/p99, write amplification) vs RocksDB
- [ ] **M12** DESIGN.md complete, README with results

### Tier 3: Stretch (pick 2–3 later)
MVCC, atomic batches, RESP server, compression, deterministic simulation testing, Raft.

## Current status

**2026-10-04: M0 done.** Scaffold committed. Nothing compiled yet (Rust not installed at scaffold time).

**2026-10-04: Mode switched.** Claude now writes each milestone; owner studies and answers questions before the next one (see CLAUDE.md).
M1 done: 7/7 memtable tests pass, clippy clean. Rust 1.99.0 installed (via TUNA mirror; Fastly route from the hotspot is slow).

**2026-10-04: D2 + M3 done** (in 4 sections: D2 fail-loud, data blocks, writer/reader, hardening tests).
43/43 tests pass, clippy clean. Mutation-checked: an off-by-one planted in the index search and a skipped footer CRC were both caught by the tests.

**Next step:** M4 (flush memtable to SSTable, read path over multiple tables, manifest). It needs a design consult first:
flush threshold, how the WAL is rotated after a flush, and how the manifest records live tables.
Owner still has the M1 + M2 + M3 review questions pending (below).

## M1 review questions (owner answers)
1. Why does `delete` insert a tombstone instead of `map.remove(key)`? What breaks once SSTables exist?
2. Why `BTreeMap` and not `HashMap`?
3. `approx_size` never shrinks on overwrite. When does that flush early, and why is it acceptable?

## M2 review questions (owner answers)
1. Why is the CRC stored first, and why does it cover the length fields, not just key + value?
2. Why does `append` not fsync? What would group commit change about latency vs throughput?
3. Why must `Db::open` truncate the torn tail before appending? (Hint: the `writes_after_torn_tail_are_not_lost` test)
4. `decode` uses `checked_add` on lengths read from disk. What happens without it on a corrupted file?

## M3 review questions (owner answers)
1. The index stores each block's *last* key, not its first. Walk through `get("m")` when block 0 ends at "k" and block 1 ends at "p". Why does `partition_point(|e| e.last_key < key)` find the right block?
2. Why fsync the file *before* the rename, and the directory *after*? What could a crash leave behind if either fsync were skipped?
3. Why does the footer need its own CRC when the index and blocks already have one?
4. Why are tombstones written into SSTables at all? When can one finally be dropped? (Preview of M5 compaction.)
5. `get` takes `&self` and uses `read_exact_at` instead of seek + read. Why does that matter for concurrency?

## Blockers / open decisions
- [x] Rust 1.99.0 installed
- [x] GitHub: private repo https://github.com/keshavdhingra001/lsmkv (SSH remote, key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
- [x] Git email links to GitHub account keshavdhingra001
- [x] D2: mid-log WAL corruption fails loud (owner approved 2026-10-04)
