# lsmkv design

Living document. Every non-obvious decision gets a short entry: **what**, **alternatives**, **why**.

## Architecture

```
put/delete ──> WAL (append + fsync) ──> MemTable (BTreeMap) ──flush──> SSTable L0 ──compact──> L1..Ln
get ─────────> MemTable ──miss──> SSTables newest-first (bloom filter -> index -> block)
```

## Decisions

### D1: WAL record format
- **What:** `[crc32][kind][key_len][val_len][key][value]`, little-endian, CRC over everything after the CRC field.
- **Alternatives:** LevelDB-style 32 KiB blocks with fragmented records; no checksum.
- **Why:** Simplest format that still detects torn and corrupt writes. Revisit block framing if replay speed matters.

### D2: Torn-tail handling
- **What:** Replay stops at the first invalid record. `Db::open` truncates the file to the last valid offset before appending.
- **Why:** Without truncation, new writes land after garbage and are lost on the next replay (see the `writes_after_torn_tail_are_not_lost` test).
- **Mid-log corruption (decided 2026-10-04: fail loud):** a complete record with a bad checksum or contents *followed by more data* returns `Error::Corruption` with the offset, and `Db::open` refuses to start, leaving the log untouched.
  A crash can only tear the *last* record, so data after a bad record means disk corruption, not a crash. This mirrors RocksDB's default `kTolerateCorruptedTailRecords`.
- **Zero-filled tails are tolerated:** some filesystems extend a file with zeros on a crash, which would otherwise look like corruption.
- **Known limit:** a corrupted *length* field that points past EOF looks like a torn tail, so it's tolerated silently. Fixing that needs a header checksum or LevelDB-style fixed-size blocks (Tier 3).
- **Revisit at M7:** with group commit, several unsynced records can be torn at once. The tail rule still holds, because they're all at the end.

### D3: Memtable structure
- **What:** `BTreeMap<Vec<u8>, Entry>` for now.
- **Later:** A skiplist for concurrent reads (M8).

### D4: Replay reads the whole log into memory
- **What:** `Wal::replay` does one `fs::read` and decodes from the buffer.
- **Why:** The log is bounded by the memtable size (it gets rotated once flushes exist in M4), so it's small. A single read is simpler than a streaming reader.
- **Guard:** Lengths read from disk are untrusted, so `checked_add` and a bounds check run before slicing, so a garbage `u32::MAX` length can't overflow or panic.

### D5: SSTable format (approved 2026-10-04)
- **Layout:** `[data blocks][filter block][index block][footer]`. Full byte layout is in `src/sstable/mod.rs` and `block.rs`.
- **Data blocks:** about 4 KiB target (one OS page, one disk read), entries `[kind][key_len][val_len][key][value]`, then a CRC32 trailer. Tombstones are stored, because they must shadow older tables.
- **Index:** one entry per block, holding the block's *last* key, offset and size. It's kept in memory, so `get` is a binary search (`partition_point`) plus exactly one block read. A per-key index was rejected because it's about the size of the data itself.
- **Filter block:** reserved and empty, so M6 bloom filters drop in without a format change.
- **Footer (52 B):** five u64 fields, a CRC32 and an 8-byte magic `LSMKVSST`. This is a change from the proposed 48 B: the footer is the root of trust (every offset comes from it), so it gets its own CRC.
- **Validation on open:** magic, then footer CRC, then the regions must tile the file exactly, then the index CRC, then blocks must be contiguous from 0 with strictly increasing keys. No offset is trusted before it's checked. Data blocks are verified by their CRC on every read.
- **Atomic publish:** write `<name>.tmp`, fsync the file, rename it, fsync the directory. A crash leaves either no table or a complete one. An abandoned writer deletes its temp file (`Drop`).
- **Immutable:** the writer refuses to overwrite an existing table.
- **Deferred (Tier 3):** prefix compression and restart points within blocks, plus block compression.
- **Platform:** reads use `FileExt::read_exact_at` (pread), so `get(&self)` needs no `&mut` or seek state, which matters for concurrent reads in M8. It's Unix-only.

<!-- Add D6+ as milestones land: SSTable layout, flush threshold, compaction strategy, fsync policy... -->
